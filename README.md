## THE PROBLEM
Today's job market is highly competitive and crowded, making the search for relevant positions increasingly complex for both job seekers and employers. Thousands of new jobs are posted daily across various websites, making it difficult for individuals to sift through listings to find opportunities that match their qualifications and expectations.

----
## THE SOLUTION
This software provides a user-friendly interface where users can enter their skills, keywords, location, job role, and other expectations. These inputs power a web scraper that collects numerous job postings from various sites. The AI then filters through these listings to find the best matches based on the user's criteria. By automating the search process, this program delivers more efficient results than traditional methods, saving job-seekers valuable time.

## HOW TO USE
for installation and running the app, please refer to [INSTALL.md](./INSTALL.md) for the appropriate steps.
Usage of the AI is relatively simple:
1. **Enter Specifics:** Enter the specifics about your skills, location, experience, job type and job title or just the fields labelled required
2. **Click on Search:** Click on the search button and wait while the data is collected from linkedin and grab a coffee for yourself
3. **Apply for Jobs:** Out of the shown jobs, check for the ones that you like the most & apply. Don't worry, they're all the most suitable for you that were able to be found

## POSSIBILITIES FOR EXPANSION
1. Though this AI currently only scrapes LinkedIn job postings, it can be expanded to scrape from more employment sites like Unstop, Glassdoor, Monster, Indeed, and others.
2. Matching people with jobs based on their resumes.
3. Providing suggestions for skill improvement and learning resources based on resume analysis.
4. Incorporating an analytics dashboard showing trends in job roles, salaries, and skill demands and making predictions based on that data.
5. The scraper always reruns whenever a new prompt is given beacuse of which the program is more likely to get blocked due to more incoming requests.
6. The scraper only scrapes the first 100 LinkedIn jobs based on the search query, hence, the shown jobs may not always be the best suited.
7. An option for scraping jobs on the basis of job type would attract more visitors and users
8. Currently, the app is only able to scrape 1 job at a time as the same csv file is edited each time
9. As the app uses an API for it's AI, it is very lightweight but can't handle huge loads of viewers


I will continue to work on this project
